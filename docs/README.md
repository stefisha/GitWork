### What if I deposit the wrong amount?
The bot will detect this and let you know. You'll need to send the exact amount.

### Can I increase a bounty after creating it?
Remove the old label, add a new one with the higher amount, and fund the new escrow.

### What happens if no one solves the issue?
Remove the bounty label anytime to cancel and get a full refund.

### How long does claiming take?
Instantly! Once you click claim and sign with your wallet, funds arrive in seconds.
