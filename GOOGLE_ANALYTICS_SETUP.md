   and
   ```javascript
   gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
   ```

3. Replace **both** instances of `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Measurement ID

4. Save the file

5. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\Stefan\OneDrive\Desktop\GitWork
   git add gitwork-front/index.html
   git commit -m "add Google Analytics tracking ID"
   git push origin main
   
   # Copy to Octavian (production)
