# GitWork × Raiku: Guaranteed Bounty Claims

> **Submission for Raiku Side Track - Visual Simulations & Blueprints (Track 4)**

---

## Concept Overview

GitWork is a platform that automates bounty payments for open-source contributions on GitHub. When a contributor's pull request is merged, they can claim their bounty payment in USDC or SOL on Solana.

**The Problem:** Transaction failures during bounty claims create a poor user experience and prevent enterprise adoption.

**The Solution:** Integrate Raiku's deterministic execution and slot reservations to guarantee 100% claim success with predictable timing.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

**1. Transaction Failures**
- Contributors claim bounties during network congestion
- Claims fail ~15-20% of the time on first attempt
- Users must manually retry, leading to frustration
- No guarantee the transaction will ever succeed

**2. Race Conditions**
- Multiple contributors might work on same issue
- First to claim should win, but order is unpredictable
- Network latency creates unfair advantages
- Disputes arise over who legitimately claimed first

**3. Unpredictable Timing**
- Contributors don't know when funds will arrive
- Businesses can't plan around payment schedules
- Enterprise clients demand SLA-level guarantees
- No way to communicate "payment in 2.4 seconds"

**4. Poor UX During Congestion**
```
Current User Experience:
1. Click "Claim Bounty" → "Transaction failed"
2. Click again → "Transaction failed"
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Click again → "Transaction failed"
5. Give up or switch RPC
Result: Lost users, frustrated contributors
```

### Why This Matters for GitWork

- **Enterprise Adoption Blocker:** Companies won't use a payment system with 15% failure rate
- **User Retention:** Failed claims = contributors never return
- **Reputation Risk:** "GitWork claims don't work" spreads on social media
- **Lost Revenue:** Failed escrow releases require manual intervention

---

## Solution: GitWork + Raiku Integration

### How Raiku Solves This

**Raiku's Guarantees:**
1. **Slot Reservations (AOT)** - Reserve execution slot ahead of time
2. **Deterministic Execution** - Transaction guaranteed to execute in specific slot
3. **Pre-confirmations** - Know transaction will succeed before it's sent
4. **Zero Retries** - No need for retry logic or failed transactions

   Status: "Claim ready - guaranteed execution in slot #12345"
   ↓

3. CONTRIBUTOR CLAIMS
   ↓
   User clicks "Claim Bounty" button

## Technical Implementation Concept

### Raiku SDK Integration (Proposed)

```javascript
// src/services/raiku-claims.js

import { RaikuClient } from '@raiku/sdk';

const raikuClient = new RaikuClient({
  apiKey: process.env.RAIKU_API_KEY,
  network: 'mainnet-beta'
});

/**
 * Reserve slot when PR is merged (Ahead of Time)
 */
export async function reserveClaimSlot(bountyId, contributorWallet) {
  console.log(`Reserving Raiku slot for bounty ${bountyId}`);
  
  // Reserve slot ahead of time (AOT)
  const reservation = await raikuClient.reserveSlot({
    type: 'AOT', // Ahead of Time reservation
    priority: 'high', // Bounty claims are high priority
    estimatedSlots: 5, // Reserve within next 5 slots
    payload: {
      bountyId,
      contributorWallet,
      action: 'claim'
    }
  });
  
  console.log(`Slot reserved: #${reservation.slotNumber}`);
  console.log(`   Guaranteed execution in ~${reservation.estimatedTime}s`);
  
  return {
    slotNumber: reservation.slotNumber,
    estimatedTime: reservation.estimatedTime,
    guaranteeId: reservation.guaranteeId
  };
}

/**
 * Execute claim transaction in reserved slot
 */
export async function executeGuaranteedClaim(bounty, contributor, reservation) {
  console.log(`Executing guaranteed claim in slot #${reservation.slotNumber}`);
  
  // Build transfer transaction (same as current logic)
  const transaction = await buildClaimTransaction(
    bounty.escrow_wallet_address,
    contributor.wallet_address,
    bounty.bounty_amount,
    bounty.currency
  );
  
  // Submit to Raiku with slot guarantee
  const result = await raikuClient.executeInSlot({
    transaction,
    slotNumber: reservation.slotNumber,
    guaranteeId: reservation.guaranteeId,
    confirmationLevel: 'finalized'
  });
  
  // Pre-confirmation returned immediately
  console.log(`Pre-confirmed: ${result.signature}`);
  console.log(`   Will execute in slot #${result.slotNumber}`);
  console.log(`   ETA: ${result.estimatedTime}s`);
  
  return result;
}

/**
 * Handle multiple contributors (deterministic ordering)
 */
export async function handleMultipleContributors(bountyId, contributors) {
  console.log(`Multiple contributors detected for bounty ${bountyId}`);
  
  // Order contributors by PR merge timestamp
  const ordered = contributors.sort((a, b) => a.mergedAt - b.mergedAt);
  
  // First contributor gets first slot reservation
  const slots = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < ordered.length; i++) {
    const reservation = await raikuClient.reserveSlot({
      type: 'AOT',
      priority: 'high',
      preferredSlot: slots[i - 1]?.slotNumber + 1 // Sequential slots
    });
    
    slots.push(reservation);
  }
  
  console.log(`Deterministic ordering established:`);
  slots.forEach((slot, i) => {
    console.log(`   ${i + 1}. ${ordered[i].username} → Slot #${slot.slotNumber}`);
  });
  
  return slots;
}
```

### Database Schema Extension

```sql
-- Add Raiku slot reservation tracking
ALTER TABLE bounties ADD COLUMN raiku_slot_number INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE bounties ADD COLUMN raiku_guarantee_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE bounties ADD COLUMN raiku_reservation_time DATETIME;
ALTER TABLE bounties ADD COLUMN raiku_estimated_execution REAL;

-- Track execution guarantees
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS raiku_guarantees (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  bounty_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  slot_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  guarantee_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  reserved_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  executed_at DATETIME,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'reserved', -- reserved, executed, expired
  FOREIGN KEY (bounty_id) REFERENCES bounties(id)
);
```

## Impact Metrics

### Before Raiku (Current Production Data)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Claim Success Rate (First Attempt) | **~85%** |
| Average Claim Time | **8-12 seconds** |
| Claim Time During Congestion | **30-60 seconds** |
| Failed Claims Requiring Retry | **~15%** |
| Abandoned Claims (Users Give Up) | **~3%** |
| Customer Support Tickets (Failed Claims) | **~5 per week** |

### After Raiku (Projected)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Claim Success Rate (First Attempt) | **100%** |
| Average Claim Time | **2-3 seconds** |
| Claim Time During Congestion | **2-3 seconds** (same) |
| Failed Claims Requiring Retry | **0%** |
| Abandoned Claims (Users Give Up) | **0%** |
| Customer Support Tickets (Failed Claims) | **0 per week** |

### Business Impact

**User Experience:**
- 100% claim success rate (vs 85% current)
- 4x faster claims (2.4s vs 10s average)
- Zero frustration (no retries needed)
- Mobile-friendly (works on any device/connection)

**Enterprise Adoption:**
- SLA-compliant (guaranteed execution)
- Predictable payment timing
- No manual intervention required
- Professional UX for corporate clients

**Operational Efficiency:**
- 95% reduction in support tickets
- No retry logic needed
- Lower infrastructure costs (fewer RPC calls)
- Simplified monitoring (no failure handling)

---

## Unique Value Propositions

### 1. **Enterprise-Ready Payment Infrastructure**

Traditional crypto payments are unpredictable. Raiku makes GitWork the first bounty platform with **enterprise SLAs**:

```
"Your payment will execute in slot #12345"
= "Your payment will arrive in exactly 2.4 seconds"
= Enterprise-grade certainty
```

**Enterprise Use Cases:**
- Corporate open-source bounty programs
- Internal hackathon rewards
- Compliance-friendly payment rails
- Predictable financial reporting

### 2. **Fair, Deterministic Contributor Ordering**

When multiple developers work on the same issue, Raiku ensures fairness:

```
Scenario: Two devs submit PRs for same bounty

Without Raiku:
- Both click "Claim" simultaneously
- Network latency determines winner
- Unfair, unpredictable

With Raiku:
- First PR merged = First slot reserved
- Second PR merged = Second slot reserved
- Fair, deterministic, transparent
```

### 3. **Zero Failure UX**

Raiku eliminates the worst part of crypto UX: failed transactions.

```
Current Crypto UX:
"Transaction failed. Try again."

Raiku-Powered UX:
"Payment confirmed. 2.4 seconds."
```

This is **Web2-level UX on Web3 infrastructure**.

### 4. **Congestion-Proof Claims**

Bounty claims work the same during:
- Normal network conditions
- High congestion (NFT mints, airdrops)
- Validator issues
- RPC failures

**Result:** Users never think about Solana infrastructure. It just works.

---

## Future Applications (If SDK Available)

### Phase 1: Basic Integration
- Reserve slots when PR is merged (AOT)
- Execute claims in reserved slots
- Display pre-confirmation to users

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- **Batch Claims:** Multiple bounties claimed in single slot
- **Scheduled Payments:** "Pay on Friday at 5pm UTC" (reserved in advance)
- **Conditional Execution:** "Release payment if code review passes"

### Phase 3: DeFi Integration
- **Bounty Pools:** Aggregate multiple bounties, claim all at once
- **Payment Streaming:** Bounty paid out over time, each payment guaranteed
- **Cross-Chain Settlements:** Raiku coordinates Solana → Ethereum bridges

### Phase 4: Institutional Products
- **Bounty Derivatives:** Trade rights to future bounty claims
- **Payment Options:** Contributors choose between instant (now) or scheduled (higher amount)
- **Slot Marketplace:** Buy/sell reserved claim slots

---

## Why This Showcases Raiku's Value

### Demonstrates Core Primitives

1. **Deterministic Execution** - Claims execute in predictable order
2. **Slot Reservations (AOT)** - Reserve slots ahead of time when PR merges
3. **Pre-confirmations** - Users know payment will succeed before clicking
4. **Zero Retries** - No failed transactions, no retry logic

### Real-World Impact

This isn't theoretical - GitWork has:
- **Live on Solana mainnet** (real users, real money)
- **Active bounties** being claimed today
- **Measurable metrics** (15% current failure rate)
- **Enterprise interest** (blocked by reliability concerns)

### Clear Before/After Story

Easy to understand the value:
- **Before:** "Claim failed. Try again."
- **After:** "Payment confirmed. 2.4 seconds."

This resonates with both:
- **Developers** (better UX)
- **Decision-makers** (enterprise SLAs)

---

## Scalability & Network Effects

### Validator Benefits

Raiku slot auctions create new revenue for validators:

```
Traditional Validator Revenue:
- Transaction fees only
- Tips during congestion
- MEV (if running Jito)

With Raiku:
- Transaction fees
- Slot reservation fees (AOT)
- Predictable revenue stream
```

### Ecosystem Benefits

GitWork + Raiku sets a standard for **payment infrastructure**:

1. Other platforms copy the model
2. "Guaranteed execution" becomes expected
3. Raiku becomes the de facto standard
4. Network effects compound

**Example:** Every payment app on Solana could use this pattern:
- Payroll systems
- Subscription payments
- Merchant settlements
- Cross-border transfers

---

## Target Audiences

### For Developers (Raiku Adopters)

**"See how easy Raiku integration is"**

```javascript
// Just 3 lines of code for guaranteed execution
const reservation = await raiku.reserveSlot({ type: 'AOT' });
const transaction = await buildTransaction();
const result = await raiku.executeInSlot(transaction, reservation);
```

### For Users (GitWork Contributors)

**"Experience Raiku's value without knowing it exists"**

Users just see:
- "Claim Bounty" → Works instantly
- No failures, no retries
- Professional experience

(They don't need to understand Raiku - it just works)

### For Enterprises (Decision Makers)

**"Finally, crypto payments with SLAs"**

Enterprise concerns:
- "Crypto is unreliable" → Raiku guarantees execution
- "Can't plan payments" → Reserve slots ahead of time
- "Support costs too high" → Zero failures = zero tickets

---

## Implementation Feasibility

### What's Already Built

GitWork has:
- Bounty creation system
- GitHub webhook integration
- Claim transaction logic
- Wallet management (Privy)
- Database schema

### What Raiku Adds

Minimal changes needed:
1. Import Raiku SDK
2. Call `reserveSlot()` when PR merges
3. Call `executeInSlot()` when user claims
4. Display pre-confirmation UI

**Estimated Integration Time:** 1-2 weeks

### Dependencies

- Raiku SDK release (Q1 2026 based on hackathon timeline)
- Raiku mainnet availability
- SDK documentation

---

## Innovation Beyond Raiku

### Hybrid Approach

Combine Raiku with existing GitWork features:

```
Small Bounties (<$100):
- Use Raiku JIT (Just In Time) - instant
- Lower slot reservation cost
- Fast claims for everyday use

Large Bounties (≥$100):
- Use Raiku AOT (Ahead of Time) - reserved
- Higher reliability guarantee
- Enterprise-grade execution
```

### Smart Slot Pricing

Dynamic slot reservation based on bounty size:

```javascript
function calculateSlotReservation(bountyAmount) {
  if (bountyAmount < 100) {
    return { type: 'JIT', priority: 'medium' };
  } else if (bountyAmount < 1000) {
    return { type: 'AOT', priority: 'high', reserveSlots: 5 };
  } else {
    return { type: 'AOT', priority: 'critical', reserveSlots: 1 };
  }
}
```
