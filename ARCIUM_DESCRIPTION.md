# Arcium Integration in GitWork

GitWork integrates Arcium's Multi-Party Computation (MPC) network to enable encrypted bounty amounts, solving a critical privacy problem in public blockchain bounties. When a repository owner creates a bounty using the `gitwork:currency:encrypted:amount` label format, the bounty amount is encrypted using Arcium's MPC architecture before being stored. This ensures that the actual bounty value remains hidden from public view until it's claimed by the contributor who completes the work. The integration leverages Arcium's Client and Reader SDKs (v0.3.0) to perform encryption operations, with authorization-based decryption that only allows specific parties (the repo owner and the assigned contributor) to view the actual amount.

This privacy layer unlocks enterprise adoption by enabling corporate clients to offer bounties without publicly disclosing compensation amounts, prevents gaming behaviors where high-visibility bounties attract spam rather than quality contributions, and provides contributors with earnings privacy since their total bounty claims aren't publicly tracked on-chain. The system includes automatic fallback mechanisms to ensure reliability, with graceful degradation to local encryption if the Arcium MPC network is temporarily unavailable. The implementation adds five REST API endpoints for encryption/decryption operations, a dedicated EncryptedBountyBadge UI component that displays the encrypted status with lock icons and tooltips, and comprehensive backend logic that seamlessly handles both standard and encrypted bounties within the same transaction flow.
