## 👋 Hey Dev Community!

I just launched [GitWork](https://gitwork.io) - a platform that lets developers earn money for open source contributions, and I wanted to share it with you!

## 🤔 The Problem

We all love open source, but let's be honest:
- Contributors work for free
- Maintainers struggle to incentivize quality PRs
- Promising projects stall due to lack of funding
- The "pay for open source" platforms have high fees and friction

## 💡 The Solution: GitWork

GitWork makes funding open source as simple as adding a GitHub label.

### How it works:

1. **Repo owners** add a label to any issue: `gitwork:usdc:50`
2. **Funds are escrowed** on Solana blockchain (transparent & secure)
3. **Contributors** find bounties at [gitwork.io](https://gitwork.io)
4. **Solve the issue**, submit a PR
5. **When merged** → you get paid automatically in USDC! 💰

No middleman. No waiting. No fees (except tiny Solana network fees).

## 🚀 Why This is Different

**GitHub Native**: Works directly in your workflow. No separate platform to manage.

**Blockchain Escrow**: Funds are locked in Solana smart contracts. Contributors know the money is there.

**Instant Payments**: USDC hits your wallet when the PR is merged. No 30-day waiting periods.

**Zero Platform Fees**: We don't take a cut. You earn what the bounty offers.

**Open Source First**: Built by developers, for developers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

For the nerds (me included 🤓):

**Frontend**:
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router

**Backend**:
- Node.js + Express
- SQLite
- GitHub App integration

**Blockchain**:
- Solana
- USDC (SPL Token)
- Privy for wallet management

**Infrastructure**:
- PM2
- Nginx
- Deployed on VPS

## 📊 Current Status

We're in **alpha** right now! 🎉

What works:
- ✅ Create bounties via GitHub labels
- ✅ Automatic escrow on Solana
- ✅ Search and discover bounties
- ✅ Claim and verify contributions
- ✅ Automatic USDC payments

We're onboarding projects now. If you maintain a repo and want to offer bounties, hit us up at support@gitwork.io!

## 🎯 Use Cases

**For Maintainers**:
- Fund specific features or bug fixes
- Incentivize community contributions
- Attract quality developers
- Build sustainable projects

**For Contributors**:
- Earn from your skills
- Choose projects you care about
- Get paid fairly and instantly
- Build portfolio + income

**For Companies**:

- Transparent spending

## 🌟 Why Solana?

You might wonder: "Why blockchain? Why Solana?"

**Transparency**: Anyone can verify escrow funds on-chain

**Global**: Pay developers anywhere, no banking friction

**Fast**: Transactions confirm in 400ms

**Cheap**: Network fees are fractions of a cent

**Programmable**: Smart contracts ensure automatic payment

## 🔮 What's Next?

Built a dApp that brings real utility: GitWork - GitHub bounties on Solana
```

**Content**:
```
Hey Solana fam! 👋

Just shipped GitWork - a platform that uses Solana for something we've all wanted: getting paid for open source work.

**What it does:**
Turns GitHub issues into USDC bounties. Funds are escrowed on Solana, payments are automatic when PRs merge.

**Why Solana?**
- Fast enough for instant payments
- Cheap enough for small bounties ($5-50 range)
- Global - pay devs anywhere
- Transparent escrow anyone can verify

**The flow:**
1. Repo owner labels issue: `gitwork:usdc:50`
2. Funds locked on Solana
3. Dev solves issue
4. PR merged → USDC sent automatically

We're in alpha, onboarding projects now.

Check it out: https://gitwork.io
GitHub: https://github.com/stefisha/GitWork

**Tech details for the curious:**
- Using USDC SPL token
- Privy for wallet management
- GitHub App for automation
- Sub-second payment confirmation

Would love feedback from the Solana community! What features would make this more useful?

```
Built a platform to make open source sustainable - GitWork
```

**Content**:
```
Hi r/opensource! 

I've been contributing to OSS for years and always wished there was a simple way to get compensated. So I built it.

**GitWork** - Turn any GitHub issue into a paid bounty.

**The problem we're solving:**
- Quality contributors work for free
- Maintainers can't incentivize specific features/fixes
- Projects die from lack of funding
- Existing platforms are clunky with high fees

**Our approach:**
- Works natively in GitHub (just add a label)
- Blockchain escrow (Solana) - transparent & trustless
- Automatic payments when PR is merged
- Zero platform fees

**Example:**
```
Issue: "Add dark mode support"
Label: gitwork:usdc:100
Escrow: ✅ Locked on-chain
Contributor: Solves issue
PR: Gets merged
Payment: Automatic USDC transfer
```

**Current status:**
Alpha launch - we're onboarding projects.

**Philosophy:**
We believe open source should be:
- Sustainable for contributors
- Affordable for maintainers
- Transparent for everyone

Not trying to replace passion with profit - just making it possible to do what you love AND pay rent.

**Links:**
- Site: https://gitwork.io
- Code: https://github.com/stefisha/GitWork
- Email: support@gitwork.io

**Questions for the community:**
- What concerns do you have about paid OSS?
- What would make you trust this system?
- What features are missing?

Would love your thoughts! 🙏

### Post 3: r/webdev

**Title**:
```
I built a bounty platform for GitHub issues (paid in crypto)
```

**Content**:
```
Hey r/webdev,

Spent the last few months building GitWork - a platform where you can earn money solving GitHub issues.

**Stack (for the curious):**
- Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind
- Backend: Node.js + Express + SQLite
- Blockchain: Solana (USDC payments)
- Integration: GitHub App API

**How it works:**
Maintainers add labels like `gitwork:usdc:50` to issues. Funds get escrowed on Solana. When you solve it and PR is merged, you get paid automatically.

**Why I built this:**
Tired of doing free work on side projects while bills pile up. Wanted to make OSS contributions financially viable.

**Why blockchain:**
- Transparent escrow (anyone can verify funds)
- Instant global payments
- No platform fees
- Programmable (automatic payments)

**Live demo:** https://gitwork.io

**Open source:** https://github.com/stefisha/GitWork

Still in alpha, but functional. Would love feedback from fellow devs!

What do you think - would you use this as a contributor? As a maintainer?

### Twitter Thread:

```
🧵 I just launched GitWork - here's why open source contributors deserve to get paid (and how we're making it happen)

1/ The problem: OSS powers 90% of software, yet contributors work for free. Burnout is real. Projects die. This isn't sustainable.

2/ Enter GitWork: Turn any GitHub issue into a paid bounty. Label it, escrow funds on Solana, get paid when PR merges. Simple.

3/ Why blockchain? 
- Transparent escrow
- Instant payments
- Global access
- No middleman fees

Solana makes micro-payments actually viable.

4/ We're in alpha, onboarding projects now. If you maintain a repo or want to earn from contributions, check it out 👇

https://gitwork.io

5/ This is just the beginning. Imagine a world where talented developers can make a living doing what they love - building open source.

Let's make it happen 🚀
```

### LinkedIn:

```
🚀 Excited to announce GitWork!

After years of contributing to open source (for free), I decided to build a solution.

GitWork turns GitHub issues into paid bounties:
• Maintainers add a simple label
• Funds are escrowed on Solana blockchain
• Contributors solve issues
• Payment is automatic when PR merges

Why this matters:
- Open source powers 90%+ of software
- Contributors burn out working for free
- Quality projects need sustainable funding

We're using Solana because it's:
✅ Fast (400ms confirmations)
✅ Cheap (sub-cent fees)
✅ Global (no banking friction)

Current status: Alpha launch, onboarding projects

Check it out: https://gitwork.io

Would love your thoughts - is this the future of open source funding?
