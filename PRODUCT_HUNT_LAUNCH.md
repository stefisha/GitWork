```

**Full Description** (Write in Notion/Google Doc first):
```markdown
## 🎯 The Problem
Open source contributors work for free. Maintainers struggle to incentivize quality contributions.

## ✨ The Solution
GitWork turns any GitHub issue into a paid bounty using Solana blockchain:

1. 💰 Repo owners label issues with bounty amounts (e.g., `gitwork:usdc:50`)
2. 🔒 Funds are escrowed in Solana smart contracts
3. 👨‍💻 Contributors find and solve bounties
4. ✅ When PR is merged, payment is automatic
5. 💸 Contributor gets paid in USDC instantly

## 🚀 Key Features
- **GitHub Native**: Works directly in your GitHub workflow
- **Blockchain Escrow**: Funds are safe and transparent
- **Instant Payments**: USDC sent automatically on merge
- **Zero Fees**: No platform commissions (only network fees)
- **Open Source Friendly**: Built for the dev community

## 💡 Perfect For
- Open source maintainers wanting to fund development
- Developers looking to earn from contributions
- Companies supporting open source projects
- Web3 projects building in public

## 🌟 Why GitWork?
Traditional bounty platforms are clunky and take high fees. GitWork is:
✅ Native to GitHub
✅ Powered by Solana (fast, cheap)
✅ Fully automated
✅ Transparent and trustless

We're in alpha - onboarding projects now! 🎉
```
